Testing traffic sent to your instances
In the Google Cloud console, from the Navigation menu, go to Network services > Load balancing.

Click on the load balancer that you just created (web-map-http).

In the Backend section, click on the name of the backend and confirm that the VMs are Healthy. 
If they are not healthy, wait a few moments and try reloading the page.

When the VMs are healthy, test the load balancer using a web browser, going to http://IP_ADDRESS/, 
replacing IP_ADDRESS with the load balancer's IP address.

This may take three to five minutes. If you do not connect, wait a minute, and then reload the browser.

Your browser should render a page with content showing the name of the instance that served the page, 
along with its zone (for example, Page served from: lb-backend-group-xxxx).
